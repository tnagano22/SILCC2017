# The Students and Instructors of Languages at Community Colleges (SILCC) Surveys

## Introduction
- The Students and Instructors of Languages at Community Colleges (SILCC) Surveys were designed in consultation with an expert panel of community college language instructors, researchers and administrators. Two survey instruments were developed – one for students and one for instructors – in order to better understand the demographics and motivations of community college language students, as well as the experiences and pedagogical methodologies of community college language instructors. In this repository, you will find the anonymized survey data from the administration of the survey in Fall 2015, the survey instruments, and findings from the surveys.

## Data
- In the "data" folder, you will find two data sets; one for the results of student surveys (1,756 responses) and the other for the results of instructor surveys (140 responses). See the following documents for more information about the data sets and the summary results.
