This survey instrument was developed by the Language at the Community College Nexus project team at the Center for Integrated Language Communities (CILC). This survey instrument was originally used as part of the Students and Instructors of Languages at Community Colleges Surveys study in Fall 2015. The survey is designed to take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. The development of this survey instrument was partially funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. If you have any questions, you can contact CILC at 212-817-2086 or cilc@gc.cuny.edu. (Printed on \today)}}
